<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Master's degree in Engineering in 2007 from Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University) and a Senior Software Developer at Cinia Group Ltd. (formerly Kilosoft Ltd.) in Ilmala, Helsinki. I was born in 1975 in Helsinki and in addition to this and my current home town of Espoo, I have lived for two periods in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, the first period being 8 months at 6-7 years of age and the latter period being for 3 months at 13 years of age.</p>

<p>I am not a real good language expert, but besides my mother tongue Finnish, I can speak English fluently, also good Estonian and Swedish and fairly German.</p>

<p>My main hobbies are chess, programming also during leisure time and techno music, I also visit the gym fairly often and I am interested on heraldics. I have written myself some courses about computer science and mathematics to the page of <a href="http://www.tslespoo.fi" target="_blank">a local worker's charity organization</a> acting in Greater Helsinki Area.</p>
